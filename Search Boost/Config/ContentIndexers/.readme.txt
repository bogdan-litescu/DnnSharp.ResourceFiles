This folder configures the various Content Indexers that are used by Search Boost to get relevant content. 
A content indexer is basically a plugin that reads content from a source (such as database, files, etc) and makes it
available for Search Boost to index.

Normally you don't need to change the configuration in this folder unless you want to add your own plugins to gather content from 
new sources. In this case, create a new XML file simillar to .defaults.xml in terms of structure.

To implement a custom indexing plugin, reference  avt.SearchBoost.Core.dll in your project and
implement avt.SearchBoost.Core.Indexing.ISearchBoostIndexer interface.

Then, create a new XML file in this folder and add your type like in the example below.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<indexers>
    
    <indexer>
        <type>My.Indexer, My.Assembly</type>
    </indexer>
	
</indexers>
