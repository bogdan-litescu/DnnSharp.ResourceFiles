ModuleIndexerExt

DNN Search interface is limiting. For example it doesn't provide capability to module providers to specify security per search item. 
We added this feature to Search Boost especially to allow handling this situations. 
Additional data about a module will be fetched by Search Boost through separate queries and linked to the same search item.

.defaults.xml contains the default module extensions. Do not change this file as it will get overwritten on upgrades. 
Contact us if you want to share your extensions with the rest of the worlds and we'll include it in the defaults.
Otherwise, create your own xml files simillar to .defaults.xml that contain the nodes you want to override.

Valid tokens to use inside queries are:

{databaseOwner}     = DotNetNuke.Common.Utilities.Config.GetDataBaseOwner()
{objectQualifier}   = DotNetNuke.Common.Utilities.Config.GetObjectQualifer()
{searchKey}         = searchItem.SearchKey
{guid}              = searchItem.GUID
{title}             = searchItem.Title
{author}            = searchItem.Author (User Id)
{pubDate}           = searchItem.PubDate (DateTime)
{moduleId}          = searchItem.ModuleId
{description}       = searchItem.Description
