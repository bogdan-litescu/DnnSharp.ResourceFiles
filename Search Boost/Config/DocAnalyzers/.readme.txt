This folder configures the document analyzers that Search Boost uses to determine which files to index.
The default indexer looks at the files in the portal root folders and indexes everything according to configuration.
But sometimes the logic for these files resides somewhere else, for example in the database.
Search Boost allows you to define custom analyzers that are triggered by a path.
In the existing configuration, the "/dmx" path will trigger the DbControlledFolderAnalyzer which takes some of the meta from the database.

.defaults.xml contains the default analyzers. Do not change this file as it will get overwritten on upgrades. 
Instead, create your own xml files simillar to .defaults.xml that contain the nodes you want to override.

For example, to add your own analyzer to ignore a /temp folder like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<filesearch>
    
    <analyzer>
        <title>Ignore my temp folder</title> <!-- Title is like an ID, make sure it's unique -->
        <match>
            <path>/temp</path>
        </match>
        <type>avt.SearchBoost.Core.DocAnalyzer.IgnoreFolderAnalyzer, avt.SearchBoost.Core</type>
    </analyzer>
	
</filesearch>
