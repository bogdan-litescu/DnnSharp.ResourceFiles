Search Boost Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ContentIndexers folder

This folder configures the various Content Indexers that are used by Search Boost to get relevant content. 
A content indexer is basically a plugin that reads content from a source (such as database, files, etc) and makes it
available for Search Boost to index.

Normally you don't need to change the configuration in this folder unless you want to add your own plugins to gather content from 
new sources. In this case, create a new XML file simillar to .defaults.xml in terms of structure.


FileIndexers folder

This folder configures the FILE indexers that Search Boost diplays in the admin console for users to enable.
An indexer is basically an association create between one or more file extensions and a class that implements IFileIndexing.
This means you can extend Search Boost to index new file types by creating your own class that 
implements IFileIndexing (link to avt.SearchBoost.Core.dll) and then add it to an xml file simillar to ".default.xml".
Whenever you change this files, if changes are not instantly visible in the amdin console (which should happen automatically), 
please restart the application.


ModuleIndexerExt

DNN Search interface is limiting. For example it doesn't provide capability to module providers to specify security per search item. 
We added this feature to Search Boost especially to allow handling this situations. 
Additional data about a module will be fetched by Search Boost through separate queries and linked to the same search item.
