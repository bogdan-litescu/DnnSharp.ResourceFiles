This folder configures the FILE indexers that Search Boost diplays in the admin console for users to enable.
An indexer is basically an association created between one or more file extensions and a class that implements IFileIndexing.
This means you can extend Search Boost to index new file types by creating your own class that 
implements IFileIndexing (link to avt.SearchBoost.Core.dll) and then add it to an xml file simillar to ".default.xml".
Whenever you change this files, if changes are not instantly visible in the amdin console (which should happen automatically), 
please restart the application.

.defaults.xml contains the default indexers. Do not change this file as it will get overwritten on upgrades. 
Instead, create your own xml files simillar to .defaults.xml that contain the nodes you want to override.

For example, to add your own indexer for extension xlsx, create a new XML file, say MyIndexer.xml that looks like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<filesearch>
    
    <indexer>
        <title>Excel Documents</title>
        <default>false</default>
        <extensions>
          <ext>xlsx</ext>
        </extensions>
        <type>My.Indexer, My.Assembly</type>
    </indexer>
	
</filesearch>
